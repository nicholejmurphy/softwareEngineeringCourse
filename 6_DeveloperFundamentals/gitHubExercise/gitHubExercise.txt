# Hatchways ****GitHub Exercise****

## **Part I**

Let\'92s start by taking a bit of time to practice the git workflow below. It is so valuable to just practice this workflow a couple times, since you will most likely doing it professionally as well as in your individual projects and open source contributions. Here are some things to do.

1. Create a local repository and add and commit some files

cd Desktop/SE_Career/Unit6
mkdir gitHubExercise
cd gitHubExercise
git init
touch index.html app.css app.js
git add .
git commit -m "added first files"

2. Create a remote repository and push your code from the local repo to the remote

git remote add origin git@github.com:nicholejmurphy/gitHubExercise.git
git push -u origin main

3. Create a local branch and add and commit some files

git checkout -b firstBranch
touch app.js app.css
git add .
git commit -m "added js and css files"

4. Push that local branch to GitHub to create a remote branch

git push --set-upstream origin firstBranch


## **Part II - Put your JavaScript Timers Exercise on GitHub pages**

Using GitHub pages, deploy your JavaScript Timers Exercise from the previous unit so that you can share them with anyone!}
