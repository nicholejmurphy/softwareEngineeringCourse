Part One: Solidify Terminology
In your own terms, define the following terms:

What is HTTP? // Hypertext Transfer Protocol

What is a URL? // Universal Resource Locator

What is DNS? // Domain Name System

What is a query string? // An argument that is passed in at the end of a HTTP/HTTPS request

What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different? // GET: is a request that does not modify the server's data & POST: is a request that does modify the server's data with information sent through the body of the request.

What is an HTTP request? // A message sent out to a server to retrieve an API address and its content. This can include specific versions/information it wants to pull inside of the request header.

What is an HTTP response? // A response message that returns the content of the requested address, which includes a header and the status of such response.

What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen. // A header contains specifications of the request and response that is being ran. Examples: Language, content-type, hostname, cookies, cached information, etc. 

What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser? // The browser uses the hypertext transfer protocol to find an IP address for somesite.com with the specific file of /some/page.html, likely with port 80. It will take the information that it finds and sends a response back with (hopefully) this rendered address as a web page.

Part Two:
Using curl, make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”
// curl https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search\?term\=pirate

Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com
// dig icanhazdadjoke.com // 172.67.198.173

Make a simple web page and serve it using python3 -m http.server. Visit the page in a browser.
